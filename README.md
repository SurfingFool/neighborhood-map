# Neighborhood Map

## Description
This application uses the Google Maps javascript API to render a map, along with markers, indicating popular restaurant venues in the San Marcos, California area.  Using Foursquare, a third party API, additional venue information is returned when the user clicks on a venue.  [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html) is implemented to automatically update the user interface when a search feature is used.

## Installation
Though one can run this application without an authentication api key, it is recommended to obtain a standard one for free on your own website. Directions for obtaining an API Key can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
When using the Foursquare API, please obtain your own Client ID and Client Secret at [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/developers/app) by creating an App which involves filling out a few simple fields. In addition, you need to download all files/folders associated with this application packaging them together in a single folder.
